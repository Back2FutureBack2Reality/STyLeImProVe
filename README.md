# STyLeImProVe - Ethical Open Source Guidelines

## Project Overview
This project focuses on promoting ethical standards and responsible practices in open source development and collaboration.

## Purpose
To provide guidelines and documentation for:
- Ethical content standards in open source projects
- Responsible repository management
- Community safety and security practices
- Best practices for content review and reporting

## Important Note on Platform-Level Changes
This repository contains documentation and guidelines for ethical practices. It cannot implement platform-wide changes to GitHub's content moderation systems, as those would require changes at the GitHub platform level by GitHub's engineering teams.

## Documentation
- [Ethical Guidelines](ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md) - Comprehensive guidelines for responsible development
- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - Community standards and behavior expectations
- [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Process for ethical contributions
- [Content Moderation Guidelines](CONTENT_MODERATION.md) - Understanding platform vs. repository-level solutions
